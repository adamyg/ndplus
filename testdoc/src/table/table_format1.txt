Title:          ND Basic Table Format

        Similar to the ND format, is the 'basic' layout, which uses a
        fixed format column defined by the header like the ND format.
        Unlike most other format. this simplified form does not
        require explicit row markers, yet is at the cost of limited
        formatting features.

Topic:          General syntax rules

        o Column headers are defined with a leading *[* (open square
            bracket) and optionally closed using the *]* (close
            square bracket).

        o Rows are single lines of text; any text outside the
            original column definition shall be ignored.

        o Data shall be appended to the previous line if prefixed with a '+'.

        o Blank lines are ignored.

        o Termination of the table body is by a *(end)* marker.

Example:

        The following table <Example NDBasic Table> is an example of
        an basic style table.

(start table "Example Basic Table", Caption, format=basic)

    [Column Description  ]      [Column 2               [Column 3        ]

    Row 1, column 1 text   xxx  Row 1, column 2 text    Row 1, column 3     ignored text
  + additional text             additional text         addition text

    Row 2, column 1 text        Row 2, column 2 text    Row 2, column 3
    Row 3, column 1 text        Row 3, column 2 text    Row 3, column 3

(end table)
