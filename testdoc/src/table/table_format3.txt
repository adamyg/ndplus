Title:          CSV Table Format

        The table Comma Seperated Value *(CSV)* format uses a similar syntax as 
        <Simple Table Format> with support for quoted columns of dating.


Topic:          General syntax rules

        While no formal specification for CSV exists, RFC 4180 describes a common
        format and establishes "text/csv" as the MIME type registered with the IANA,
        with the CVS table syntax following these guidelines.

        o A new table body is introducted with the following marker;

                *(start* *table* '[title],' '[caption],' format=csv ',[options ..]' *)*

        o Unless the option 'header=no' is given, the first line is taken as
          the column headers.

        o All non-blank lines are taken as cell text.

        o Each record is one line terminated by a new line.

        o Fields that contain a special character (comma, newline, or double quote), 
          must be enclosed in double quotes. (i.e "data, with a comma").

        o A double quote character can be embedded within the field text by ecaping
          the character, by placing another double quote character next to it
          within the field definition (ie "").

        o Termination of the table body is by a *(end)* marker.


Example:
(start table Title, Caption, format=csv)
"Column1", "Column2", "Column3",

"Column1.1", "Column1.2", "Column1.3",

"Column2,1", "Column2.2", "Column2.3"

"Column3.1", "Column3,2", "Column3,3"

     "Column4.1","Column4.2","Column4.3",

  """Column5.1""" , "Column""5.2""" , "Column5.3"

        Column6.1 , Column6.2, Column6.3

        Column7.1 , , Column7.3

        Column8.1 ,, "Column8.3
 over two lines"

(end table)

Example Two:

(start table format=csv)
Year,Make,Model,Features,Price
1997, Ford,  E350," ac, abs, moon"  ,3000.00
1997, Ford,  E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999, Chevy, "Venture ""Extended Edition""",,4900.00
1996, Jeep,  Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00
(end table)

        This CSV example illustrates that

        * First line is taken as the column headers,
        * Fields that contain commas and double-quotes must be quoted,
        * A quote within a field must be escaped with an additional quote immediately 
          preceding the literal quote,
        * Space before and after delimiter commas may be trimmed.
