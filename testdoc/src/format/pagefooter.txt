    Title:      Page Footer

        You can set a global page footer which is appended to the end of each generated
        page.

    Example:

        The page footer defined within 'Menu.txt' used during the generation of this
        document is as follows:

(quote)
PageFooter: 'To' 'send' 'feedback' 'on' 'this' 'topic' *email:* nobody@earth.org
PageFooter: <Copyright> (c) 'Some' 'rights' 'reserved.'
(end)

        This is an addition to the standard ND features of 'Footer' and 'Timestamp'
        which are both also configured within 'Menu.txt':

(quote)
Footer: Copyright (c) 2007 Nobody.
Timestamp: Generated on mon day, year
(end code)
