    Title:      Definition Lists

        You can add a definition list by using the format below, specifically text
        space dash space text.


                                -------------------------

    Topic:      Overview

        The standard ND definition syntax is supported plus a number of extensions
        including <Levelling>, <Continuation> and <Mixed> usage.

        Like bullet lists, you can have blank lines between them if you want,
        subsequent lines dont have to be indented, and you end the list by skipping a
        line and doing something else.

    Source:
(start code)
        First  - This is the first item.
        Second - This is the second item.
                 This is more of the second item.
        Third  - This is the third item.
        This is more of the third item.

        Some text after the definition list.
(end code)

    Result:
        First  - This is the first item.
        Second - This is the second item.
                 This is more of the second item.
        Third  - This is the third item.
        This is more of the third item.

        Some text after the definition list.

    Notes:
        Remember that with definition lists, if you're using the plural form of the
        keywords each entry is a symbol and can be linked to just as if it had its own
        topic.

                                -------------------------

    Topic:      Levelling

        Definition lists can represent multiple levels of elements directed by the
        indentation of each line, for example;

        desc - list 1
        desc - list 2
                desc - list 2.1
                        desc - list 2.1.1
                        desc - list 2.1.2
                desc - list 2.2
                        desc - list 2.2.1
                        desc - list 2.2.2
        desc - list 3

        Start of normal paragraph reset indentation.

(code)
Source:
        desc - list 1
        desc - list 2
                desc - list 2.1
                        desc - list 2.1.1
                        desc - list 2.1.2
                desc - list 2.2
                        desc - list 2.2.1
                        desc - list 2.2.2
        desc - list 3
(end)


                                -------------------------

    Topic:      Continuation

        Definition list content maybe stated over a number of lines. Text which is line
        seperated and indented by one shall be taken as a continuation of the bullet
        definition and added as a seperate paragraph, for example.

(start code)
Source:
        item - description 1

                paragraph description 1

                paragraph description 1

        item - description 2

                paragraph description 2

                paragraph description 2

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                paragraph description 2.1.1

                                paragraph description 2.1.1

                        item - description 2.1.2
                item - description 2.2
                        item - description 2.2.1
                        item - description 2.2.2
        item - description 3
                item - description 1
                item - description 2
        item - description 4
                item - description 4.1

                        paragraph description 4.1

    Notes:  Paragraphs must be line seperated and indented.
(end)

        item - description 1

                paragraph description 1

                paragraph description 1

        item - description 2

                paragraph description 2

                paragraph description 2

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                paragraph description 2.1.1

                                paragraph description 2.1.1

                        item - description 2.1.2
                item - description 2.2
                        item - description 2.2.1
                        item - description 2.2.2
        item - description 3
                item - description 1
                item - description 2
        item - description 4
                item - description 4.1

                        paragraph description 4.1

    Notes:
        One should be aware that during list formatting an incorrect decrease in
        indentation restarts in the indentation logic closing the related list which may
        product unexpected results, for example;

    Source:
(start code)
        item - description 1

        item - description 2

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                Second paragraph description 2.1.1

                                First paragraph description 2.1.1

                        More text for description 2.1.1 <= wrong indentation resets the
                        list depth to zero closing the current list definition and
                        starting a new paragraph.

                item - description 2.2

        item - description 3

                item - description 2
(end code)

    Result:
        item - description 1

        item - description 2

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                Second paragraph description 2.1.1

                                First paragraph description 2.1.1

                        More text for description 2.1.1 <= wrong indentation resets the
                        list depth to zero closing the current list definition and
                        starting a new paragraph.

                item - description 2.2

        item - description 3

                item - description 2

        You may also note that is this reset affect disallows additional paragraphs to
        be appended once sub items have been encountered.

        Both the reset logic and the inablity to append are currently by design.

    Topic:      Mixed

        Definition lists can be mixed within other ND list constructs. The definitions must
        be line seperated and indented by one to be associated.

    Source:
(start code)
        item - description 1

                paragraph description 1.1

                paragraph description 1.2

        item - description 2

                paragraph description 2.1

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                paragraph description 2.1.1

                                o bullet 1
                                o bullet 2
                                        o bullet 2.1

                item - description 2.2
                        item - description 2.2.1
                        item - description 2.2.2

        item - description 2

                o bullet 1
                o bullet 2
(end code)

        item - description 1

                paragraph description 1.1

                paragraph description 1.2

        item - description 2

                paragraph description 2.1

                item - description 2.1
                        item - description 2.1.1

                                o bullet 2
                                        o bullet 2.1

                        item - description 2.1.2

                item - description 2.2
                        item - description 2.2.1
                        item - description 2.2.2

        item - description 2

                o bullet 1
