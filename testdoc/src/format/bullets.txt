    Title:      Bullet Lists
        
        You can add bullet lists by starting a line one of the following four
        characters seperated by a space;

        o dash (-)

        o asterisk (*), 

        o o (o)
      
        o plus (+).

                                -------------------------

    Topic:      Overview

        The standard ND bullet syntax is supported plus a number of extensions
        including <Levelling>, <Continuation> and <Mixed> usage.

        Bullets can have blank lines between them if you want, and subsequent lines
        dont have to be indented. You end a list by skipping a line and doing something
        else.

    Source:
(start code)
        - Bullet one.
        - Bullet two.
          Bullet two continued.
        - Bullet three.

        Some text after the bullet list.

        o Spaced bullet one.

        o Spaced bullet two.
          Spaced bullet two continued.

        o Spaced bullet three.

        Some text after the spaced bullet list.
(end code)

    Result:
        * Bullet one.
        * Bullet two.  Bullet two continued.
        * Bullet three.

        Some text after the bullet list.

        * Spaced bullet one.
        * Spaced bullet two.  Spaced bullet two continued.
        * Spaced bullet three.

        Some text after the spaced bullet list.

    Topic:      Levelling

        Bullet lists can represent multiple levels of elements directed by the
        indentation of each line, for example;

    Source:
(start code)
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2
                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1
                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1
(end code)

    Result:
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2
                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1
                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1

        Start of normal paragraph resets indentation.

    Topic:      Continuation

        Bullet list content maybe stated over a number of lines. Text which is line
        seperated and indented by one shall be taken as a continuation of the bullet
        definition and added as a seperate paragraph, for example.

    Source:
(start code)
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                More text for bullet 2

                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1

                                Additional text for bullet 2.1.1
 
                                More text for bullet 2.1.1

                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1
(end code)

    Result:
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                More text for bullet 2

                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1

                                Additional text for bullet 2.1.1
 
                                More text for bullet 2.1.1

                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1

    Notes:
        One should be aware that during list formatting an incorrect decrease in
        indentation restarts in the indentation logic closing the related list which may
        product unexpected results, for example;

    Source:
(start code)
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1

                                Additional text for bullet 2.1.1
 
                    More text for bullet 2.1.1 <= wrong indentation resets the list 
                        depth to zero closing the current list definition and 
                        starting a new paragraph.

                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
        o bullet 3
(end code)

    Result:
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                More text for bullet 2

                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1

                                Additional text for bullet 2.1.1

                    More text for bullet 2.1.1 <= wrong indentation resets the list 
                        depth to zero closing the current list definition and 
                        starting a new paragraph.

                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1


        You may also note that is this reset affect disallows additional paragraphs to
        be appended once sub items have been encountered.

        Both the reset logic and the inablity to append are currently by design.

    Topic:      Mixed

        Bullet lists can be mixed within other ND list constructs. The definitions must
        be line seperated and indented by one to be associated.

    Source:
(start code)
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                item 2.1 -      item description
                item 2.2 -      item description

                o bullet 2.1
                        o bullet 2.1.1

                                Additional text for bullet 2.1.1

                                item 2.1.1 -    item description
                                item 2.1.2 -    item description

                        o bullet 2.2.1
                        o bullet 2.2.2
        o bullet 3
                o bullet 3.1
                        o bullet 3.1.1
        o bullet 4
                o bullet 4.1

        Start of normal paragraph resets indentation.
(end code)

    Result:
        o bullet 1
        o bullet 2

                Additional text for bullet 2

                item 2.1 -      item description
                item 2.2 -      item description

                                item 2.1.1 -    item description
                                item 2.1.2 -    item description

                        o bullet 2.1.2
                o bullet 2.2
                        o bullet 2.2.1
