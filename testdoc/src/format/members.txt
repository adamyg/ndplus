    Title:      Member documentation

        For languages with Full Language Support (e.g. C and C++) you may document
        members and parameters by placing a documentation block after the member
        instead of before.

        For this you have to put an additional < marker in the comment block.

     Examples:

>               int var;        /*!< Description after the member */

        This block can be used to put a Qt style detailed documentation block after a
        member. Other ways to do the same are:

>               int var;        /**< Description after the member */

        or

>               int var;        //!< Description after the member
>                               //!< 

        or

>               int var;        ///< Description after the member
>                               ///< 

        Note that these blocks have the same structure and meaning as an explicit topic
        within comment blocks in the previous section only the < indicates that the
        member is located in front of the block instead of after the block.

        Here is an example of mixed usage:

(start example)
        /**
         *      MyClass
         */
        class MyTest {
        public:
                /** An enum type,
                 *      The following is an eumeration
                 */
                enum MyEnum {
                        int eval1,      /*!< enum value 1 */
                        int eval2,      /*!< enum value 2 */
                        int eval3,      /*!< enum value 3 */
                };

                void member();          //!< a member function
    
        protected:
                int value;              /*!< an integer value */
        };
(end example)
