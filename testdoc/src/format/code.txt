        o example

(start code)

        Code snippet one ... (start code)/(end)

(end)

        o source

>(start code)
>
>       Code snippet one ... (start code)/(end)

>(end)

    Second form:

        o example

(code)

        Code snippet two ... (code)/(end)

(end)

        o source

Topic:          Line prefixes

        Code sections using line prefixes *(>)*, *(|)* or *(:)* as the

        fashion as '(code)/(end)' code snippets, examples.

    First form:

        o example

>       Code snippet four ...

        o source

(code)
>       Code snippet four ...
(end)


    Secord form:

        o example

|       Code snippet five ...

        o source

(code)
|       Code snippet five ...
(end)


    Third form:

        o example

:       Code snippet six ...

(code)
:       Code snippet six ...
(end)

Topic:          Quote regions

        Similar to nature 'code sections' are 'quote regions' in that they
        retain there line breaks, yet have an alternative stype applied.

        There primary use is within <Admonitions>, allowing example text
        not to be formatted.

>(quote)
>       This should be two lines ...
>               and the second
>(end)

(quote)
        This should be two *lines* ...
                and the second
