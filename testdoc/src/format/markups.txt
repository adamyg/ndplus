Title:          Formatting

        You can add basic markups by using the following formats.


Topic:          Text markups

        The design spirit of Natural Docs is that document layout within
        the original source files which shall generally read just as easily
        as the generated documentation.

        The standard ND markups are available plus a number of extensions
        including 'italic' and ~~strikethrough~~.

   Example:
(start code)
        *Bold text*

        _Underlined text_

        Paragraphs are broken by skipping lines. So the two lines above
        each have their own paragraph, but these three lines are all part
        of the same one.
(end code)

   Result:
        *Bold text*

        _Underlined text_

        Paragraphs are broken by skipping lines. So the two lines above
        each have their own paragraph, but these three lines are all part
        of the same one.

Topic:          Text Markups

    Quoted:

                            -----------------

Topic:          Possible Additions

        In addition to the above, the following are being considered
        as future enhancements; following *AsciiDoc* and several Wiki's.

                            -----------------

        > {{this line should contain monospaced text}}.

    Result:

        {{this line would contain monospaced text}}.


        > ??citation??

                            -----------------

    Result:

        -- citation.

                            -----------------

        > *_underlined and bold_*


    Result:

        *_underlined and bold_*

                            -----------------

        > *'underlined and italic'*


    Result:

        *'underlined and italic'*

                            -----------------

        > ^^superscript^^

    Result:

        ^^superscript^^

                            -----------------

        > ,,subscript,,

    Result:

        ,,superscript,,


        Finally a strict markup mode is being considered
        'markup=strict' (See: <Modelines>) requiring the use of
        double leading and trailing *[ ' * _ ]* characters for italic, 
        bold and underlined text; bring *ND+* inline with a number of
        wiki's.

    Topic:      Specials

        A number of automatic special character conversions shall
        occur when their text equivilent is used;
