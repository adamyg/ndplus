    Title:      Modelines

        You can embed per file configuration details within an
        individual source image to allow fine tunning of its
        representation.

                         ----------------------------

    Topic:      Overview

        Similar to many editors, including vim and Emacs a ND+ specific
        modeline can be positioned within the first 5 lines or last 25
        lines of the source file allowing specific file scope options
        to be configured.

        The general format of the modeline is a list of comma seperated
        feature settings between a set of *-ND-* markers.

    Example:
(start code)

        /* -ND- numericlists=no, bulletlists=no, indent=4 -ND- */

(end code)

      *Note:* 

        Use within plain-text files have the additional requirement that
        the -ND- marker *must* on an isolated line with only white-space
        leading and/or trailing.

                         ----------------------------

     Topic:     Features

        The following features for any given source image can be controlled
        thru an embedded modeline. The purpose of this interface is to
        allow work-arounds for issues within source documentation that can
        not done by editing the original material.

        naturaldocs=yes|no -    Enable/disable Natural Docs.

        numericlists=yes|no -   Enable/disable numeric lists.

        bulletlists=yes|no -    Enable/disable bullet lists.

        deflists=yes|no -       Enable/disable definition lists.

        leveling=yes|no -       Enable/disable automatic bullet/definition or
                                numeric leveling.

        prototypes=yes|no -     Enable/disable Prototype:/Synopsis:
                                inlined prototypes topics.

        admonitions=yes|no -    Enable/disable admonitions.

        code=yes|no|strict  -   Enable (yes), disable(no) or enforce strict.


     Strict Mode:

        Then specified within a modeline using 'code=strict'; as on the
        source of this page; inline code snippets are only parsed when
        the leading character being one of *">, : or |"* is positioned
        at the left edge of the line, Otherwise the text shall be
        treated like a simple text line, for example

        > Normal text

>       Code text

                         ----------------------------

    Topic:      Emacs Emulation

        In addition, *ND+* supports to number of emacs style modelines
        allowing either of two normal forms:

        You can specify the major mode for editing a given file by the
        following special text in the first nonblank line of the file.
        The modeline can be on the line by itself or surrounded by
        comments. For example:

>               -*-C++-*-

        If the first line is the name of a recongnised style, such as
        'perl' or 'C++', ND+ uses a language parser approapriate to the
        mode. The above tells ND+ to use Lisp mode. Note how the
        semicolon is used to make Lisp treat this line as a comment.
        Such an explicit specification overrides any defaulting based
        on the file name.

        Another other supported format of the mode specification is an
        explicit mode package:

>               -*- mode: modename; -*-

                         ----------------------------

     Topics:    ModeLine Example

        The source information of this document has the following ND
        configuration, with the result following.

>               -ND- admonitions=no,prototypes=no,code=strict -ND-


        Prototype:

           Now a normal topic.

        Note!:

           Now a normal topic!

        | this is normal text, despite the leading *'|'* character.
