     Title:     Admonitions

        Admonition's allow hilited reminders and notes.

        'Tip', 'Note', 'Important', 'Warning' and 'Caution', plus 'Example'
        admonishment paragraph styles are generated by placing the words
        'Tip!:', 'Note!:', 'Important!:', 'Warning!:', 'Caution!:' and
        'Example!:' as the first word of the paragraph.

        Like all headers they are case insensitive.

        Furthermore, unlike standard headers, any trailing component shall
        become part of the heading.
