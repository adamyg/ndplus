    Title:      Numbered Lists

        You can define a Numbered list by using the format below, specifically text
        within a leading number. space followed by text.

                                -------------------------

    Topic:      Overview

        This is a ND+ extension which also allows <Levelling>, <Continuation> and
        <Mixed> usage with other ND constructs.

        Like bullet and definition lists, you can have blank lines between them if you
        want, subsequent lines dont have to be indented, and you end the list by
        skipping a line and doing something else.

        The numbers need not be sequentially numbered as the underlying ordered list
        which is generated shall be Numbered started from one.

    Topic:      Levelling

        Numbered lists can represent multiple levels of elements directed by the
        indentation of each line, for example;

(start code)
        1. Numbered 1

        1. Numbered 2

                1. Numbered 2.1

                        1. Numbered 2.1.1

                        1. Numbered 2.1.2

                1. Numbered 2.2

                        1. Numbered 2.2.1

        1. Numbered 3

                1. Numbered 3.1

                        1. Numbered 3.1.1
        1. Numbered 4

                1. Numbered 4.1

        1. Numbered 2

                1. Numbered 2.1

                        1. Numbered 2.1.1

                        1. Numbered 2.1.2

                1. Numbered 2.2

                        1. Numbered 2.2.1

    Topic:      Manual Levelling

        Unlike Bullet Lists and Definition Lists, numbered list allow manual leveling
        by means of a dot notation represents the desired structure. 

        Note that once a dotted list is encountered, automatic leveling for
        the duration of the list shall be disabled.

    Topic:      Continuation

        Numbered list content maybe stated over a number of lines. Text which is line
        seperated and indented by one shall be taken as a continuation of the Numbered
        definition and added as a seperate paragraph, for example.

    Notes:
        One should be aware that during list formatting an incorrect decrease in
        indentation restarts in the indentation logic closing the related list which may
        product unexpected results, for example;

    Source:

         1. Numbered 1
         1. Numbered 2

                 Additional text for Numbered 2

                                Additional text for Numbered 2.1.1

                    More text for Numbered 2.1.1 <= wrong indentation resets the list
                        depth t 1. zer 1. closing the current list definition and
                        starting a new paragraph.

                         1. Numbered 2.1.2

         1. Numbered 4
                 1. Numbered 4.1


        You may also note that is this reset affect disallows additional paragraphs to
        be appended once sub items have been encountered.

        Both the reset logic and the inablity to append are currently by design.
