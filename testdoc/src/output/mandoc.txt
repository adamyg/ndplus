Title:          ManDoc

   Overview:

        'mandoc' is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro
        language of choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the
        predominant historical language for UNIX manuals. It is small, 
        ISO C, ISC-licensed, and quite fast.

        The main component of the toolset is the mandoc utility
        program, based on the libmandoc validating compiler, to
        format output for UNIX terminals (with support for
        wide-character locales), XHTML, HTML, PostScript, and PDF.

        mandoc has predominantly been developed on OpenBSD and is
        both an OpenBSD and a BSD.lv project. We strive to support
        all interested free operating systems, in particular
        DragonFly, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Minix 3, and GNU/Linux, as well
        as all systems running the pkgsrc portable package build
        system.

   Usage:

        Example NaturalDocs command line usage

                an ASCII representation (for example <Ditaa>).
