        PlantUMLis a Java component that allows you to quickly write.

   Usage:

        Diagrams are defined using a simple and intuitive language.

        The following examples are taken from the current PlantUML
        Language Refererence Guide.

         http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf

   Examples:

(start plantuml)
        Alice ->  Bob: Authentication Request
        Bob   --> Alice: Authentication Response
        Alice ->  Bob: Another authentication Request
        Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
(end plantuml)

   Source:

>(start plantuml)
>
>       Alice ->  Bob: Authentication Request            
>       Bob   --> Alice: Authentication Response         
>       Alice ->  Bob: Another authentication Request    
>       Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response   
>
>(end plantuml)

(start plantuml)
        :Main Admin: as Admin
        (Use the application) as (Use)
        User -> (Start)
        User --> (Use)
        Admin ---> (Use)

        note right of Admin : This is an example.

        note right of (Use)

        A note can also
        be on several lines
        end note

        note "This note is connected\nto several objects." as N2
        (Start) .. N2
        N2 .. (Use)
(end plantuml)
