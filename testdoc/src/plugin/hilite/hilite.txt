Title:          SyntaxHighlighter

Topic:          Introduction

        Syntax highlighting of code is defined using the same syntax a <Code Snippets>.

        The feature can be explicity enabled using the 'hilite=type' option or
        implicity via forcing all code snippets to be highlighted.

(start code hilite=cpp)
/*  Function:   strchr
        Search for a given character within a string

    Description:
        This function finds the first occurence of <[c]> (converted to a char) in the
        string pointed to by <[string]> (including the terminating null character).

    Returns:
        Returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer if <[c]> does not
        occur in <[string]>.
 */
char *
strchr (const char *s1, int i)
{
    const unsigned char *s = (const unsigned char *)s1;
    unsigned char c = (unsigned int)i;

    while (*s && *s != c)
        ++s;
    if (*s != c)
        s = NULL;
    return (char *) s;
}
(end code)
