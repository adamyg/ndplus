        can be directly updated or removed if requried.

        See the specific plugin for copyright and usage information.

        The following are possible future plugins.

                o <PlantUML> - UML diagrams.

                o <timing-gen>

                o <RRDiagram>

        Any others, please contact.

   Important!:

        Not all plugins are portable across platforms, hence there
        use may determine the hosts on which *ND+* can be executed.

        Whereas the generate documentation should be fully portable, 
        including the bundled <SyntaxHilite> implementation, being
        JavaScript(tm) based.

        <Mscgen> is a Windows(tm) only executable application.

        <Ditaa>, <SDEdit> and <PlantUML> all require Java(tm) is be
        available on the host; visible within the current *PATH*.

(end!)
