        http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/

    license:

        You may use any SyntaxHighlighter project under the terms of either
        the MIT License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3.

        The MIT License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and
        easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you
        can do with a SyntaxHighlighter project.

        If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use a
        SyntaxHighlighter project under that license.

        You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the
        other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are
        using. You are free to use a SyntaxHighlighter project in
        commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.

Topic:          Mscgen Source

        Mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart
        descriptions and produces PNG, SVG, EPS or server side image maps
        (ismaps) as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are a way of
        representing entities and interactions over some time period and
        are often used in combination with SDL. MSCs are popular in
        Telecoms to specify how protocols operate although MSCs need not be
        complicated to create or use. Mscgen aims to provide a simple text
        language that is clear to create, edit and understand, which can
        also be transformed into common image formats for display or
        printing.

        Generate railroad diagrams from code or BNF. Generate BNF from code.

        RR Diagram allows to generate railroad diagrams (also called syntax
        diagrams) from code or from BNF notation. The output format is a
        very compact SVG image which can be integrated to web pages and
        where rules can contain links.

        RR Diagram can also be used to generate BNF notation from a model.
