Title:          Introduction

        *Natural Docs Plus* package *(ND+)*.

        NaturalDocs allows developers to review and share their code
        comments in a browser. ActionScript, C#, and Perl developers
        should consider using this documentation generator because
        these languages are fully supported by NaturalDocs. Fully
        supported languages come with the following features:

                o Implicit comment generation
                o Inheritence diagrams
                o Automatic scope detection

        Firstly this set of pages where generated using *ND+* and
        shall demonstrate many of the New Features available to
        Natural Docs users with minimal changes to existing documents.

    Caution!:   BETA Product

        It is easy to state ND+ has not endued the same level of
        public usage and related testing as the primary 'Natural
        Docs' package has since it initial release.

        ND+ is fairly stable in that it has been privately used for a
        number of years across several projects, despite this it
        should be only for non 'casual' users or unless there are
        specific features you require not currently available.

        *Natural Docs* is an open-source documentation generator for
        multiple programming languages. You document your code in a
        natural syntax that reads like plain English. Natural Docs
        then scans your code and builds high-quality HTML
        documentation from it.

        *ND+* is a fork of what was *Natural Docs 1.4* with a number
        of enhancements hopefully under the same philosophy as
        'Natural Docs' was originally developed.

    Philosophy:

        The original 'Natural Docs'.

        It was designed to have as little visible syntax as possible.
        I/we specifically do not want tags littered everywhere thru
        the source, like '=head1' for 'POD' or '@param' for Javadoc, 
        which look and feel unnatural.

        While it is structured, it's minimal and mostly transparent.
        The comments in the source files read just as easily as the
        generated documentation.

    New Features:

            o <Packages> - ND+ breaks away from a one-to-one relationship
                of source pages and the produced result.

                *ND+* permits packages to split across files, which
                may then be merged and/or split into a number of
                documents.

                As an example, pulling both header/include
                definitions and the underlying source code function
                definitions together into a single view.

            o <Tables> - Several difference table formats are
                available.

            o <Prototypes> - Embedded protypes.

            o <SyntaxHighlighter> - Syntax hilighting of code snippets.

            o <Admonitions> - Highlighted reminders and notes.

            o Lists - <Definition Lists>, <Bullet Lists> and
                <Numbered Lists> support multiple leveled definitions.

            o <Modelines> - File level configuration options.

            o <Plugins> - Several third party ASCII art packages have
                been integrated.

            o <Page Footer> - Global page footer.


    Beta Features:

            o *C++* - Native language support.

            o <Member documentation> - Permits QT style member documentation.

            o <ManDoc> - Mandoc output generation mode.


    Coming Soon:

            o <AsciiDoc> - AsciiDoc output generation mode.
